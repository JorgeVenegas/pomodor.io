## Introduction

Pomodor.io is designed to help users enhance focus and productivity by breaking down work into intervals (usually 25 minutes) called "Pomodoros," separated by short breaks. It encourages users to stay productive and avoid burnout. This project serves as a personal exploration of modern front-end development practices.

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and remove tasks to track work progress.
- **Progress Tracker**: Visual indicators of completed Pomodoros.
- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive design, adaptable for mobile and desktop.
- **Persistent State**: State management with Redux, ensuring task data and timer progress are maintained.
